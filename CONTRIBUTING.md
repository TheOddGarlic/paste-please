If you're the one thinks that there is a better way to do things! And it's definetly not the way you did there! If you have enough experience on Javascript, or HTML all kind of helping is welcome. Unfortunately I'm not thinking of making a translatable extension since it has no visible strings all around. Just the popup with two diferent sentences. So, there's no way to contribute as a translator but it's okay! Don't worry, you can still help me out with some other important stuff!

### Contributing as a JS developer
I'd love to see better ways to do these functions, I'm really new to Chrome extension stuff and all kind of help is needed! If you are familiar with Chrome and you have a better idea about this, you can always create a Pull Request to request changes! Or you can create an issue to make a feature request or a bug report.

### Contributing as a user
Yes, this is a thing. You can contribute to the project by creating issues, reporting bugs and requesting new features! I'd really love to hear back from you! Thanks for the help, you're awesome!
